# Optimal Device Selection in Spectrum Sharing Channel under Energy Harvesting Aided D2D Communication

## Abstract

Spectrum sharing and device-to-device (D2D) communications are among the key enablers of
the upcoming modern communication networks. These new technologies have gained widespread
attention in cellular network standards for proximity communication as a means to improve
cellular spectrum utilization. However, due to the broadcast nature of wireless communication,
the information exchange between wireless devices is susceptible to numerous attacks.
In this project, we are interested in investigating physical layer security in the spectrum sharing
channel when both the primary cellular and the underlying Energy Harvesting (EH) aided D2D
secondary systems are interested in transmitting secret messages. The considered system model
consists of a multi-user cellular system and an underlying secondary system comprising K EHaided
D2D pairs. All cellular and EH-aided D2D transmissions are subject to an eavesdropping
attack. Given the primary’s secrecy condition, KS devices transmit secret messages and KJ
devices operate as friendly jammers. The presented results are for two scenarios: In the first
case, each EH-aided D2D pair have enough energy to transmit secret messages; however, the
transmission of jamming signals is constrained by the amount of energy harvested. In the
second case, we divide the device transmission operation time into multiple sub-slots, and each
D2D pair utilizes its harvested energy to transmit secret messages or send jamming signals.
For each scenario, we propose a device selection scheme to determine the optimal number
of devices (KS and KJ ), that maximizes the secrecy throughput of the secondary system
while satisfying the primary’s secrecy sum-rate condition. The obtained results show that the
proposed device selection model improves the primary secrecy performance while also allowing
secret transmission for the underlying EH-aided D2D communication.
